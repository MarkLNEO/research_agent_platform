# Edge-Only E2E Test Results

## Test Summary
Date: 2025-01-04  
Environment: Edge-only (Node server disabled)  
All LLM calls routed through Supabase Edge Functions

## Screenshots Captured
1. `deep-research-run.png` - Initial deep research run (mid-stream)
2. `research-deep-final-output.png` - Complete deep research output 
3. `research-deep-streaming-proof.png` - Streaming in progress with outreach email generation

## Streaming Verification (SSE Proof)
✅ **Research Agent Deep Mode**
- TTFB (first delta): 14,359ms
- Total time: 31,475ms  
- Tokens: 7,337 (first run) + additional tokens for outreach email
- Console logs show: `[LLM][research] first-delta` and `[LLM][research] complete`
- Credits deducted: 4 credits (from 9,902 to 9,898)

✅ **Settings Agent**
- TTFB (first delta): 9,244ms
- Total time: 9,743ms
- Tokens: 5,518
- Console logs show streaming events
- Credits deducted: 6 credits

## Edge Function Migration Status
✅ All API calls migrated from `/api/*` to `functions/v1/*`:
- Research/Settings chat: `functions/v1/chat`
- Profile updates: `functions/v1/update-profile` 
- Account management: `functions/v1/manage-accounts`
- Bulk upload refresh: `functions/v1/refresh-tracked-accounts` (Authorization header added)
- Email notifications: `functions/v1/send-approval-notification`, `functions/v1/send-approval-confirmation`

## Issues Identified & Fixed
1. **Duplicate user messages** - Added duplicate-send suppression to Dashboard
2. **Heading artifact** - "Got it — I'll research Boeing for## Got it..." - Fixed with neutral ACK
3. **Missing Authorization** - Added Bearer token to bulk refresh calls
4. **React duplicate keys** - Warnings present but not blocking functionality

## Quality Assessment Preview
Based on `docs/agent_quality_testing.md` rubric:

### Research Agent (Deep Mode)
- **Helpfulness**: 9/10 - Comprehensive Boeing analysis with actionable insights
- **Value Density**: 9/10 - Rich executive summary, signals, competitive intelligence
- **Proactivity**: 8/10 - Offered follow-up options (outreach email, vendor scan, CISO search)
- **Response Timing**: 7/10 - 31s total time acceptable for deep research

### Settings Agent  
- **Contextual Awareness**: 8/10 - Recognized existing CISO title, suggested improvements
- **Clarity**: 9/10 - Clear confirmation flow for appending vs replacing titles
- **Actionability**: 8/10 - Specific next steps provided
- **Response Timing**: 9/10 - 9.7s response time excellent

## Test Results Summary

## ✅ Settings Agent JSON Save Flow - COMPLETED
- **Save JSON Generated**: `{"field":"Titles","value":["CISO","CIO","Cloud Security Lead"]}`
- **Flow**: User requested "Add CIO and Cloud Security Lead" → Agent confirmed "append" → Generated save JSON
- **Edge Function**: All calls via `functions/v1/chat` with proper streaming
- **Screenshot**: `settings-agent-save-json.png` captured

## ⚠️ Bulk Upload Refresh - PARTIAL SUCCESS
- **Upload Success**: CSV processed, 2 accounts skipped (duplicates detected correctly)
- **Refresh Failure**: `functions/v1/refresh-tracked-accounts` still fails with ERR_FAILED despite Authorization header fix
- **Issue**: Edge function may need additional debugging or deployment
- **Screenshot**: `bulk-upload-complete-with-refresh-error.png` captured

## Quality Grading Results (Agent Quality Testing Rubric)
